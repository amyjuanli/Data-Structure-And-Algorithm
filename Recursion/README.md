# Recursion
## Goals
* Define what recursion is and how it can be used and whether it should be used in specific problems
* Understand the two essential components of a recursive function: base case & recursive case 
* Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
* Use *helper method recursion* and *pure recursion* to solve more difficult problems
  
## Recursion is everywhere 
* JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
* document.getElementById 
* DOM traversal algorithms
* Some complex data structures (like trees) 
* A cleaner alternative to iteration
  
## Call stack
*Call stack* is used to manage the call invocations. 

## Some tips on using *pure recursion*
For array, use *slice*, *spread operator*, and *concat* to make copies of array without mutating the array.
