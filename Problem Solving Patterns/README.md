# Problem Solving Patterns
## Frequency Counter

It is not an official name.
This pattern uses _objects_ or _sets_ to collect values/frequencies of values.  
This pattern can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.

## Sliding Windows

This pattern involves creating a _window_ either be an array or number from one position to another.  
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).  
Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

## Multiple Pointers

It is not an official name.
Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the
beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition.  
Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

For instance, _two pointers technique_ is an easy and efficient way to be used for searching pairs
in a sorted array.

## Divide and Conquer

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating
a process with a subset of data.  
This pattern can tremendously **decrease time complexity**.
